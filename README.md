# azure-testrunner-styler-chrome-ext

This chrome extension highlights the parameter value of each test case

On Azure Devops, the user is able to add multiple parameters to a test case. The style of the testrunner is lacking so the current parameter being tested is not obvious. This chrome extension changes the color of the current parameter so that it can be more easily identified by the user.
