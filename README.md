# azure-testrunner-styler-chrome-ext

On Azure Devops, the user is able to add multiple parameters to a test case. The style of the testrunner is lacking so the current parameter being tested is not easy to identify. This chrome extension changes the color of the current parameter so that it can be easily identified by the user when executing tests.
